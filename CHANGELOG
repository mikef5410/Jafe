GR: File storage node type
GR: The content of the nodes is streamed into and from the file, thus sparing
    memory and improving efficiency (esp. for large files)
GR: Confirmation required when deleting a node
GR: Use of JOptionPane instead of my custom dialogs, for further standardization
    with Swing.
GR: bugfix: if you created a new node, and then cancelled the action, the
            document was set in Unsaved state, but it shouldn't.
GR: set the "system" native Swing theme as default; much better-looking in 
    windows

GR: use the JDK own ZLib streams, not the custom ones anymore


  Version 0.1 to 0.2
----------------------

GR: set the titles and default position of all the windows
GR: removed the "Jafe SHA256" encryption engine, I'm just not sure if it's 
    secure
GR: removed the ugly & unuseful confirmation dialog in loading and saving files
GR: managing of the whole "unsaved state" stuff
GR: internal reorganization of method calls, etc. to reduce memory usage and
    improve readability
GR: bugfix: inserting a node as sibling of the selected one used to add it as 
            the last one on the same father, not as the next one
GR: added a panel with some infos on the currently open file
GR: substituted the load/save dialogs with the Swing standard ones
GR: the file selectors now point by default to reasonable places
GR: some dialogs are also manageable by typing a key when the button has focus
